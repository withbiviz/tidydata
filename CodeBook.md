There are 30 individuals had physical measurements taken of them while performing 6 different activities.  
The individuals are identified by number and the activities by name: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying.  
These physical measurements were then used to estimate various other variables.

The “features_info.txt” file included in the original data set for a complete description of each variable. However, this exercise only need mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
So here is the list of the variables:
